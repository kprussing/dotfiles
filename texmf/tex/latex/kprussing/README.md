Keith's LaTeX Themes
====================

This is simply a collection of my `LaTeX` customizations.  This provides
a few simply syntactic markups and my `beamer` themes.

Installation
------------

To install, simply run [SCons](www.scons.org) on the provided
`SConstruct` and copy the resultant `tex` directory to somewhere
`LaTeX` can find it.  You can will get the best results using `LuaLaTeX`
or `XeLaTeX` as your `pdfLaTeX` engine.

In transient and non-transient thermal analysis calculations voids are physically characterized by the fact that energy exchange between the surrounding surfaces of the void is primarily effected by convection and thermal radiation, whereas in the remaining solid structure energy is transferred by conduction. The discussion in this short paper will focus on the subproblem of determining the “geometric configuration” or “radiation view” factors in an enclosure defined by an arbitrary polygonal boundary on a digital computer.},

	abstract = {The effect of aerosols on 14 tropospheric photolysis reactions is examined under noncloudy and cloudy sky conditions by using a detailed one-dimensional radiative transfer model. Pure ({NH}4)2SO4, pure soot, and internal and external mixtures of the two aerosols, as well as mineral dust aerosol, are considered. Nonabsorbing aerosol generally enhances photolysis rates above and in the upper part of the aerosol layer in both noncloudy and cloudy atmospheres, with the enhancement effect reduced in the presence of clouds. In contrast, soot aerosol reduces photolysis rates under both noncloudy and cloudy sky conditions, with the reduction accentuated by a cloud layer. Mixtures of absorbing and nonabsorbing aerosols may produce enhancement or reduction in photolysis rates under clear sky conditions, whereas they generally reduce rates when a cloud is present. In the absence of cloud, sulfate aerosol at urban levels enhances tropospheric average photolysis rates from 11 to 18\% for the 14 reactions studied; soot aerosol decreases tropospheric average rates from 6 to 11\%. In the presence of a 500-m-thick stratus cloud, sulfate aerosol enhances each of 14 tropospheric average photolysis rates by about 5\%; soot aerosol decreases tropospheric average photolysis rates from 9 to 19\%},

	abstract = {A theory of spontaneous emission noise is presented based on classical electromagnetic theory. Unlike conventional theories of laser noise, this presentation is valid for open resonators. A local Langevin force is added to the wave equation to account for spontaneous emission. A general expression is found relating the diffusion coefficient of this force to the imaginary part of the dielectric function. The fields of lasers and amplifiers are found by solving the wave equation by the Green's function method. The lasing mode is a resonant state associated with a pole in Green's function. In this way, noise in lasers and amplifiers is treated by a unified approach that is valid for either gain guiding or index guiding. The Langevin rate equations for the laser are derived. The theory is illustrated with applications to traveling wave and Fabry-Perot amplifiers and Fabry-Perot lasers. Several new results are found: optical amplifier noise increases inversely with quantum efficiency; spontaneous emission into the lasing mode is enhanced in lasers with low facet reflectivities; and the linewidth of a Fabry-Perot laser with a passive section decreases as the square of the fraction of the cavity optical length that is active.},

	abstract = {The ability to control the radiative properties of objects is of prime importance in diverse areas like solar and thermophotovoltaic energy conversion, narrowband thermal emitters, and camouflage in military applications. Thermal radiation at the nanometer scale is significantly different from classical or macroscopic radiative energy transport - wave effects, such as interference and diffraction, and near-field effects play a significant role. By modeling thermal radiation as governed by Maxwell's equations and relating the source of thermal radiation to temperature induced fluctuations of electric currents, it becomes possible to capture the nanaoscale effects that differrentiate it from classical blackbody radiation. This work is focused on two aspects of nanoscale thermal radiation - the ability to tailor the emissive properties using 1D photonic crystals and the enhancement of radiative heat transfer due to electromagnetic surface waves. Theoretical investigation of thermal radiation in {ID} photonic crystals led to the proposal of new type of selective emitters using 1D metallo-dielectric photonic crystals that rival the more intricate 2D and 3D counterparts.},

Temperature rise was found to be directly proportional to input power to the eye, but highly dependent on the shape and size of the retinal image. Our measured temperature increases at the end of 10 seconds of irradiation with a {CW} argon laser were an average of 30 per cent higher than model predictions for near steadystate emperatures. It was also found that the retinal image size must be very much larger than the temperature probe for accurate measurements. Measured temperatures were generally lower than model predictions for times less than 100 milliseconds. Temperature distributions measured across the retinal image in the pigment epithelium compared very favorably with model predictions. Perspective views of two-dimensional temperature profiles across the pigment epithelium and choroid are presented for both measurements and model.},

The two methods are compared. The identity of both theories in global thermal equilibrium is proven. This identity is expressed by relations between the imaginary and real parts of the Green functions on the one side and volume integrations over products of two Green functions on the other side. The correct treatment of infinitely extended vacuum regions with respect to these integrations is discussed. The local interpretation of the two methods in open systems leads to different results: The Poynting vector calculated by the {FDT} of the first kind vanishes identically, whereas the {FDT} of the second kind results in a nonvanishing radiative heat transfer. The basic assumptions which are responsible for the different results are extensively discussed. Simple examples are dealt with to make contact with the phenomenological theory of radiative heat transfer.},

	abstract = {This work describes the surface temperature retrieval algorithm for the U.S. Department of Energy Multispectral Thermal Imager ({MTI}) satellite and its performance at three test sites. The {MTI} is a 15-band multispectral research and technology development satellite that provides high spatial resolution imagery of the earth's surface from a polar orbit. It has a capability for pixel-by-pixel retrieval of total atmospheric water vapor during the day. The surface temperature retrieval process uses atmospheric profiles of temperature and water vapor from numerical weather prediction data assimilation products available for the globe. The profiles of water vapor are scaled using the retrieved pixel-by-pixel water vapor during the day to improve atmospheric compensation within the image. The algorithm requires specification of a maximum emissivity or the acceptance of a default: here the maximum band emissivity is known and specified. The results of the algorithm are evaluated at three sites with a high degree of surface uniformity and known spectral emissivity: Lake Tahoe, {NV}/{CA}, Ivanpah Playa, {NV}/{CA}, and the Mauna Loa caldera, {HI}. At the first two sites, coincident measurements of surface temperature and emissivity are available. At Mauna Loa, surface emissivity measurements are available, but surface temperature measurements are not. Therefore, at Mauna Loa, the surface emissivity estimates derived from the surface temperature retrieval are compared with emissivity measurements. The results show that the surface temperature retrievals had a root mean square ({RMS}) difference with surface measurements of 0.6 K during the day and 1.0 K at night. This indicates, albeit weakly, that the use of pixel-by-pixel water vapor retrieved by the satellite improves the overall surface temperature retrievals. At Ivanpah Playa, all the data are daytime, and the surface temperature retrievals have an {RMS} difference with the in situ measurements of 0.8 K. The Mauna Loa emissivities derived from the surface temperature retrieval agreed excellently with in situ emissivity measurements. The approach taken to perform surface temperature retrieval, used operationally within the {MTI} research and development program, is seen to be simple and effective.},

	abstract = {The {LOWTRAN}-7 code was used to simulate remote sensing of water
vapor over 20 different surface covers. The simulation was used to
optimize the water vapor channel selection and to test the accuracy of
the remote sensing method. The channel selection minimizes the
uncertainty in the derived water vapor due to variations in the spectral
dependence of the surface reflectance. The selection also minimizes the
sensitivity of the selected channels to possible drift in the channel
position. The use of additional {MODIS} channels reduces the errors due to
the effect of haze, subpixel clouds and uncertainties in the temperature
profile. Remote sensing of the variation of water vapor from day to day
will be more accurate, because the surface reflectances vary slowly with
time. The method was applied to Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging
Spectrometer ({AVIRIS}) data},

As already discussed in a previous paper (Part 1, this issue page 254-269) dealing with the scalar Helmholtz equation there are four essential quantities. These are the dyadic volume Green's function, the dyadic surface Green's function, the dyadic free-space Green's function and the dyadic interaction operator. Huygens' principle expressed in terms of these quantities serves as a starting point. From this, we obtain Lippmann-Schwinger equations for the dyadic volume Green's function and the interaction operator as well as appropriate series expansions for both the dyadic volume and surface Green's functions. These quantities can then be used to solve electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems in the presence of nonspherical obstacles, such as light scattering. The developed formalism provides a common mathematical basis for a variety of different numerical approaches developed so far.},

Both steady and transient situations are considered. To demonstrate that the two different kinds of methods can be coupled, the radiative information for the governing energy equation is computed using the discrete transfer method and the {LBM} is used to solve the energy equation. For validation purposes, a 1-D planar conducting and radiating medium is considered. Radiatively, the medium is absorbing, emitting, and scattering. Boundaries of the medium are assumed at the specified temperatures. The heat-generation rate is considered uniform and constant throughout the medium. Transient and steady-state medium temperature and heat flux distributions are found for various values of the scattering albedo, emissivity, and conduction-radiation parameter. Results obtained by solving the energy equation using the {LBM} are compared against those solving the same using the finite-difference method and with those reported in the literature. Very good agreement is obtained. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The dependence of near-field heat exchange on doping and electron relaxation time is analyzed in the near infrared within the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. The dominant contribution to heat transfer can be controlled to arise from either interband or intraband processes. We predict maximum transfer at low doping and for plasmons in two graphene sheets in resonance, with orders-of-magnitude enhancement (e.g., 102 to 103 for separations between 0.1 μm and 10 nm) over the Stefan-Boltzmann law, known as the far-field limit. Strong, tunable, near-field transfer offers the promise of an externally controllable thermal switch as well as a novel hybrid graphene-graphene thermoelectric/thermophotovoltaic energy conversion platform.},

Theoretical analysis of near-field radiative transfer is mainly restricted to radiative transfer between two half-spaces or spheres treated in the dipole approximation (very small sphere) or proximity force approximation (radius of sphere much greater than the gap). Sphere-sphere or sphere-plane configurations beyond the dipole approximation or proximity force approximation have not been attempted. In this work, the radiative energy transfer between two adjacent non-overlapping spheres of arbitrary diameters and gaps is analyzed numerically. For spheres of small diameter (compared to the wavelength), the results coincide with the dipole approximation. We see that the proximity force approximation is not valid for spheres with diameters much larger than the gap, even though this approximation is well established for calculating forces. From the numerical results, a regime map is constructed based on two nondimensional length scales for the validity of different approximations.},

These properties arise from the non-self-adjoint or non-power-orthogonal nature of the optical resonator modes. The spontaneous-emission rate is only slightly enhanced in stable-resonator or index-guided structures, but can become very much larger than normal in gain-guided or geometrically unstable structures. Optical resonators or lens guides that have an excess noise emission necessarily also exhibit an ‘‘excess initial-mode excitation factor’’ for externally injected signals. As a result, the excess spontaneous emission can be balanced out and the usual quantum-noise limit recovered in laser amplifiers and in injection-seeded laser oscillators, but not in free-running laser oscillators.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel fluctuating-surface current formulation of radiative heat transfer between bodies of arbitrary shape that exploits efficient and sophisticated techniques from the surface-integral-equation formulation of classical electromagnetic scattering. Unlike previous approaches to non-equilibrium fluctuations that involve scattering matrices---relating "incoming" and "outgoing" waves from each body---our approach is formulated in terms of "unknown" surface currents, laying at the surfaces of the bodies, that need not satisfy any wave equation. We show that our formulation can be applied as a spectral method to obtain fast-converging semi-analytical formulas in high-symmetry geometries using specialized spectral bases that conform to the surfaces of the bodies (e.g. Fourier series for planar bodies or spherical harmonics for spherical bodies), and can also be employed as a numerical method by exploiting the generality of surface meshes/grids to obtain results in more complicated geometries (e.g. interleaved bodies as well as bodies with sharp corners). In particular, our formalism allows direct application of the boundary-element method, a robust and powerful numerical implementation of the surface-integral formulation of classical electromagnetism, which we use to obtain results in new geometries, including the heat transfer between finite slabs, cylinders, and cones.},

Then the subscatterers are divided into four groups, and the groups are in turn divided into four subgroups and so on. By using the idea found in many fast algorithms, a smaller problem can hence be nested within a larger problem. Moreover, by way of Huygen's equivalence principle, the scattering properties of a group of subscatterers in a volume can be replaced by a group of subscatterers distributed on a surface enclosing the volume. This idea is used as the basis of an algorithm which solves the scattering problem in several stages, where at each stage the interaction matrix algorithm is first used to find the scattering solution of each subgroup of subscatterers. Subscatterers are then replaced by equivalent surface subscatterers which are used in the next stage. This results in a reduction in the number of subscatterers at every stage. This algorithm can be shown to have a {CPU} time asymptotically proportional to N1.5 for N subscatterers},

The heat exchange of nanorods is plotted vs. gap to assess the impact of near-field radiative transfer as gap decreases. Graphical results of energy vs. nanorod radii are also presented.

The test field was varied in color (red or green) and size (1° or 0.57°). In one condition (green 0.57° test) the onset asynchrony of the background and test fields was also varied. The increment threshold measurements directly demonstrate saturation of the[pi]4 and [pi]5 color mechanisms and, based on the cone signal equation given by Alpern, Rushton and Torii (1970c), provide estimates of the semi-saturation constant [sigma]. For a given color mechanism, a single value of [sigma] was found to be adequate for all test flash sizes and asynchrony intervals tested; however, these values of [sigma] are about 100 times smaller than those found by Alpern et al. using the contrast-flash technique.
The Alpern et al. cone signal equation is essentially a simple gain control model. It is shown that when light intensities are correctly expressed in terms of quantum catch, the gain control model can account explicitly for both the observed cone mechanism saturation in the absence of pigment bleaching and the absence of saturation in the presence of bleaching by steady backgrounds.},

	abstract = {A self-consistent Green's function formalism in spherical coordinates, related to the scalar Helmholtz equation of acoustic and light scattering (if the latter is formulated in terms of Debye potentials, for example), is presented. The scatterer geometry is assumed to be nonspherical. The spherical geometry is covered as a limiting case. The four essential quantities of the formalism are the volume Green's function, the surface Green's function, the free-space Green's function, and the interaction operator. First it is demonstrated that Huygens' principle can be formulated purely in terms of Green functions. Based on this principle, Lippmann-Schwinger equations are derived for the volume Green's function and the interaction operator, thus allowing iterations in terms of Born series. On the other hand, the appropriate definition of the interaction operator allows approximations of the volume and surface Green's function by series expansions in terms of outgoing and incoming spherical wave functions, respectively, without any recourse to the physical boundary value problem under consideration. It turns out that the matrix elements of the interaction operator are strongly related to the so-called T-matrix introduced by P.C. Waterman [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 45 (1969) 1417; Phys. Rev. D 3 (1971) 825], thus providing a better understanding of the latter. The advantage of the self-consistent Green's function formalism is twofold. First, it serves as a consistent mathematical basis from which equivalences and differences between different solution schemes of scattering analysis, which have been developed so far, can be discussed. Second, the formalism clearly separate the methodological aspects of the solution schemes from the physical content of a certain boundary value problem.},

	abstract = {Though many materials behave approximately as greybodies across the long-wave infrared ({LWIR}) waveband, certain important infrared ({IR}) scene modeling materials such as brick and galvanized steel exhibit more complex optical properties1. Accurately describing how non-greybody materials interact relies critically on the accurate incorporation of the emissive and reflective properties of the in-scene materials. Typically, measured values are obtained and used. When measured using a non-imaging spectrometer, a given material’s spectral emissivity requires more than one collection episode, as both the sample under test and a standard must be measured separately. In the interval between episodes changes in environment degrade emissivity measurement accuracy. While repeating and averaging measurements of the standard and sample helps mitigate such effects, a simultaneous measurement of both can ensure identical environmental conditions during the measurement process, thus reducing inaccuracies and delivering a temporally accurate determination of background or ‘down-welling’ radiation. We report on a method for minimizing temporal inaccuracies in sample emissivity measurements. Using a {LWIR} hyperspectral imager, a Telops Hyper-Cam2, an approach permitting hundreds of simultaneous, calibrated spectral radiance measurements of the sample under test as well as a diffuse gold standard is described. In addition, we describe the data reduction technique to exploit these measurements. Following development of the reported method, spectral reflectance data from 10 samples of various materials of interest were collected. These data are presented along with comments on how such data will enhance the fidelity of computer models of {IR} scenes.},

The range of conditions enables quantitative assessment of the analytical approaches under carefully controlled experimental conditions. In the homogeneous system with gaseous carbon dioxide producing the carbon atomic emission signal, the standard deviation method provided a suitable metric that is directly proportional to the analyte signal and compares favorably with a traditional ensemble averaging scheme. In contrast, the applicability of the standard deviation method for analysis of non-homogenous analyte systems (e.g., aerosol systems) must be carefully considered. It was shown both experimentally and via Monte Carlo simulations that the standard deviation approach can produce an analyte response that is monotonic with analyte concentration up to a point at which the analyte signal starts to transition from a non-homogeneous system to a homogeneous systems (i.e., around a 50\% sampling point for aerosol particles). In addition, the standard deviation spectrum is capable of revealing spectral locations of non-homogeneously dispersed analyte species without {\textless}I{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/I{\textgreater} knowledge.},

We find that quantum fluctuations give an important contribution to the radiative energy transfer for low temperatures and high electric field (large drift velocities). For nonsuspended graphene the near-field radiative energy transfer gives a significant contribution to the heat transfer in addition to the contribution from phononic coupling.

It used camera-ready copy prepared by the author and was printed on low-quality paper in a soft cover with a glued binding. These measures kept the cost of the Catalog low. A major market for the Catalog was as a supplement to undergraduate and graduate heat transfer courses and graduate radiation heat transfer courses. The low price was necessary for such a market. The Second and Third Editions use web format so that the catalog can again be adopted as a text supplement as well as a reference for engineers and researchers involved in radiative transfer.
The wide use of programmable calculators and laptops makes it feasible to compute most configuration factors from algebraic relations or by numerical integration. Therefore, the number of factors presented in graphical form is reduced in this edition. Algebraic relations are presented where possible.

	abstract = {Polarization-independent broad-band absorbers in the visible regime are theoretically investigated. The absorbers are three-layered structures consisting of a lossy dielectric grating on top of a low-loss dielectric layer and a substrate of the same lossy dielectric placed at the bottom. Enhanced absorption in the underlying structure is attained over a broad range of frequency for both {TE} and {TM} polarizations. In particular, a nearly perfect absorbance (over 99.6\%) is achieved at λ ≈ 600 nm, around which the absorption spectra show a substantial overlap between two polarizations. The enhanced absorption is attributed to cavity resonance and its hybridization with a weakly bound surface wave. This feature is illustrated with the electric field patterns and time-averaged power loss density associated with the resonances.},

Such complex operations, as they are now called, necessarily place troops in close contact with local civilians?and sometimes in confrontations that lead to violence. Use of force against civilians can create local tensions that undermine efforts to rebuild a society and, thanks to the globalization of communications, widespread condemnation that can jeopardize the entire mission. Non-lethal weapons provide an additional set of tools for our troops engaged in complex operations. Research efforts to advance the types and efficacy of non-lethal weapons available to our warfighters is producing novel capabilities. One such capability is the Active Denial System ({ADS}). {ADS} can provide our troops a capability they currently do not have, the ability to reach out and engage potential adversaries at distances well beyond small arms range, and in a safe, effective, and non-lethal manner. The {ADS} can immediately compel an individual to cease threatening behavior or depart through application of a directed energy beam that provides a sensation of intense heat on the surface of the skin. The effect is overwhelming, causing an immediate repel response by the targeted individual.},

Modification of these parameters modifies the Planck blackbody equilibrium emissive power.

The film nature of the water flow in the fill zone has been approximated by droplets flow with a given velocity. The required heat and mass transfer have been achieved by controlling the droplet velocity. At that specific droplet velocity, effects of the following operating parameters on the thermal performance of the {NDWCT} have been investigated: droplet diameter, inlet water temperature, number of nozzles, water flow rate and number of tracks per nozzle. As a result, the effect of crosswind velocity on the thermal performance has been found to be significant. Crosswinds with velocity magnitude higher than 7.5 m/s have enhanced the thermal performance of the {NDWCT}.},

Cone pigment regeneration (and threshold recovery) is much faster after short bleaches than expected from the kinetics of a simple monomolecular reaction. Recovery is faster after a fixed (short) duration bleach the weaker it is. Except for the first 30 s after relatively weak bleaches and the entire recovery after a very brief ({\textless}0.001 s) saturating bright flash which bleaches a little more than 50\%, the results are accurately fit by the Dowling-Rushton relation over the entire range tested with only one arbitrary constant (the proportionality factor).

One is a differential-based four-step signal processing approach that estimates and offsets the impulsive clutter; the other approach employs short-time Fourier transform ({STFT}) to distinguish the target from foliage clutter. Both of these approaches provide better detection performance compared to the common 2-D image algorithm used for {UWB} radar. From time to time, due to the significant pulse-to-pulse variability of the foliage clutter, neither differential-based nor {STFT} approach can detect the target. In this case, we propose radar sensor network ({RSN}) and a {RAKE} structure in addition to the previous signal processing approaches for data fusion. The result shows that accurate detection can be achieved. Numerical performances have been analyzed for both cases in terms of probability of detection and probability of false alarm.},

The new formulation generally simplifies analytical calculation of angle factors. The advantages of the new representation are associated with the reduced order of the integrals (i.e., double reduced to single, quadruple reduced to double) which must be evaluated to calculate the angle factor. An additional benefit of the new representation is that integrals of simpler form are encountered than in the present representation. For the numerical evaluation of angle factors, the reduction in the order of the integrals should have great practical utility. In the case of energy exchange between an infinitesimal element and a finite area, a superposition theorem has been derived which permits results for certain basic surfaces to be linearly combined to yield angle factors for surfaces at other orientations. Several illustrations of the application of the new formulation are presented.},

The radiative thermal conductivity obtained generalizes the Rosseland diffusion approximation and is presented as function of the phase composition of the medium, the specific surface of the phase boundaries, and the spectral optical properties of the phases, namely, the refractive index and the absorption coefficient. It is applicable in the domain of parameters where the scattering of thermal radiation  can be considered in the approximation of geometrical optics. The obtained results are compared with those derived by the Mie theory for dilute dispersions. A considerable discrepancy is revealed only when the diameter of the dispersed scatterers becomes inferior to the wavelength. The results are also compared with experiments on high-temperature thermal conductivity in packed beds where the Mie theory cannot be applied because of dependent scattering of thermal radiation. The experimental validation covers the range of particle sizes from 45 μm to 11 mm and the temperature interval from {\textasciitilde}300 to {\textasciitilde}1200 K. The relation between the theory and the experiments is classified from satisfactory agreement in the best case to consistency in the worst case. (42 refs.)},

We will show that these are primarily mathematical properties, and that the principles of energy conservation and reciprocity, which express our physical experience, can be modeled by these mathematical properties. For this we have to distinguish two experimental configurations, and only one of these configurations will allow us to relate energy conservation to unitarity. Closely related to this are questions concerning the definition and measurability of the scattering quantities and the importance of the optical and generalized optical theorem.

	abstract = {The influence of rod light and dark adaptation upon cone mediated spatial acuity was studied in the near parafoveal retina of normal human observers. The luminance just necessary to detect squarewave test gratings of variable frequency provided an index of spatial acuity. Such thresholds were determined in the presence of background fields which were varied in luminance, shape, and size, or throughout the time period of dark adaptation. Spectral controls determined the type of photoreceptors influenced by all stimuli. Cone mediated spatial acuity is improved by presenting background fields too dim to directly affect cones, and is increasingly suppressed during the rod recovery stage of dark adaptation. These effects are small with spatial frequencies {\textless}4 c/deg but increase with spatial frequency to {\textgreater}1 log10 unit with the highest spatial frequency examined, 21 c/deg. These influences upon cone mediated spatial vision reflect the state of long-term adaptation of rods in a large annular area surrounding the locus to which the test grating is presented. Our results emphasize the differing influences of long-term dark adaptation and prevailing luminance level upon visual acuity. Ironically, spatial acuity is optimized under dim light conditions by selectively light adapting the receptors most sensitive to feeble stimuli, the rods.},

The concept of the Green's function of the third kind is utilized which was introduced first by Tai. It must be slightly generalized to allow the treatment of nonspherical scatterers. The following considerations reveal the conceptual equivalence between the Green's function of the third kind and Waterman's T-matrix method. It is another goal of this paper to demonstrate that the conventional boundary and volume integral equations can be also derived within the developed Green's function formalism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Extensive studies of black powder and its ingredients by use of a reference spectral library have demonstrated excellent accuracy for unknown identification.

The technique uses masking functions to measure area as a time varying signal from a sequence of silhouettes of a walking subject. Essentially, this combines the simplicity of a baseline area measure with the specificity of the selected (masked) area. The dynamic temporal signal is used as a signature for automatic gait recognition. The approach is tested on the largest extant gait database, consisting of 114 subjects (filmed under laboratory conditions). Though individual masks have limited discriminatory ability, a correct classification rate of over 75\% was achieved by combining information from different area masks. Knowledge of the leg with which the subject starts a gait cycle is shown to improve the recognition rate from individual masks, but has little influence on the recognition rate achieved from combining masks. Finally, this technique is used to attempt to discriminate between male and female subjects. The technique is presented in basic form: future work can improve implementation factors such as using better data fusion and classifiers with potential to increase discriminatory capability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here the complete calculation of the T-matrix describing the scattering of an electromagnetic wave on an isolated ion immersed in an "effective medium" is given. It is used for building , in the spirit of a mixing law, a self-consistent effective medium theory for the plasma dielectric tensor. We then extend the results obtained in Ref.

However, all current designs require stringent index-matching at the resonance condition that limits their applicability. Here, we propose and demonstrate that it is possible to relieve the index-matching requirement and to induce ultra-sharp plasmon resonances in an ordered vertically aligned optical nano-antenna phased array by transforming a dipole resonance to a monopole resonance with a mirror plane. Due to the mirror image effect, the monopole resonance not only retained the dipole features but also enhanced them. The engineered resonances strongly suppressed the radiative decay channel, resulting in a four-order of magnitude enhancement in local electric field and a Q-factor greater than 200.},

	abstract = {The results of two preceding articles on the energy dependence of the reaction and scattering cross sections are generalized. As before, the configuration space is divided into two parts. In the internal region or reaction zone there is no restriction on the type of interaction between the particles. In the external region, on the other hand, the interaction takes place between the colliding or separating particles without changing their structure (wave function). The present article deals with a more general situation than the preceding ones, first by allowing for an interaction, although only of a restricted type, outside the reaction zone. The most common type of interaction which plays a role outside the reaction zone is the electrostatic interaction of the colliding or separating particles. In addition, the present article does not restrict the angular momentum of the particles to zero, but permits the treatment of arbitrary angular momenta. The cross sections are expressed in well-known fashion in terms of the collision matrix U which is, of course, independent of the size of the internal region. U, in its turn, is expressed by the R matrix ((35) and (38)) and the quantities ω, B, and C describing the interaction in the external region. R as function of energy is given by (24), and a number of properties of this function are enumerated. None of the quantities R, ω, B, and C are strictly independent of the size of the internal region, although the combination (38), i.e., the collision matrix, of course, is.},

	abstract = {There have been several examples in which both synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) and hyperspectral imaging ({HSI}) systems collected data in support of military operations ({SMO}). {FOPEN} (foliage penetration) radar has been used to penetrate tree canopies in order to detect objects. On the other hand, spectral differences between targets and backgrounds are used in {HSI} systems. Both {SAR} and {HSI} systems may suffer substantial false alarm and leakage rates due to respective background clutter. It is expected that a combined {SAR} and {HSI} system will greatly enhance the detection and identification performance. Based on the features derived from {SAR} and {HSI} data, a fusion approach has been established. Data sets of {SAR} and {HSI} over a common area from the Dixie data collection (May 1997 from Vicksberg, Mississippi) are used in this paper to demonstrate the fusion approach. The site contained several camouflage nets and vehicles. One of the vehicles was covered under a camouflage net. Target detection is shown for each data set based on {RCS} (radar cross section) and spectral features. In particular, a transformation of the spectral measurements into principal components was used to reduce the dimensionality of {HSI} data as well as to facilitate spectral feature extraction and material identification. {SAR} and {HSI} detections were subsequently combined via image coregistration. The fusion results showed that false detections in the {SAR} image were greatly reduced with background characterization of trees from {HSI} and target detections were confirmed with detection of camouflage nets and material identification of vehicle paints},

	abstract = {All material bodies are surrounded by a fluctuating electromagnetic field because of the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the current density inside them. Close to the surface of planar sources (when the distance d⪡λT=cℏ∕{kBT}), thermal radiation can be spatially and temporally coherent if the surface can support surface modes like surface plasmon polaritons, surface phonon polaritons, or adsorbate vibrational modes. The fluctuating field is responsible for important phenomena such as radiative heat transfer, the van der Waals interaction, and the van der Waals friction between bodies. A general formalism for the calculation of the power spectral density for the fluctuating electromagnetic field is presented and applied to the radiative heat transfer and the van der Waals friction using both the semiclassical theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field and quantum field theory. The radiative heat transfer and the van der Waals friction are greatly enhanced at short separations (d⪡λT) between the bodies due to the evanescent electromagnetic waves. Particularly strong enhancement occurs if the surface of the body can support localized surface modes like surface plasmons, surface polaritons, or adsorbate vibrational modes. An electromagnetic field outside a moving body can also be created by static charges which are always present on the surface of the body due to inhomogeneities, or due to a bias voltage. This electromagnetic field produces electrostatic friction which can be greatly enhanced if on the surface of the body there is a two-dimensional electron or hole system, or an incommensurate adsorbed layer of ions exhibiting acoustic vibrations. Applications of radiative heat transfer and noncontact friction to scanning probe spectroscopy are discussed. The theory gives a tentative explanation for the experimental noncontact friction data.},

The direct imaging approaches are in contrast to previous {DESI} imaging studies where indirect analysis via imprints were used in order to overcome the morphological barrier presented by the layer of cuticular waxes covering the surface of a leaf or a petal. In order to enable direct imaging of such plant materials, a new ternary solvent system is introduced, providing a higher and more stable signal from soft plant materials than the binary solvent systems typically used in {DESI}. With this ternary solvent system, it was possible to image a number of very long chain fatty acids ({VLCFAs}), a significant class of metabolites located in the cuticle layer in leaves and petals, as well as other plant metabolites. In the case of the petals of H. perforatum, all common metabolites could be imaged directly using the ternary solvent, whereas in the case of leaves from the same plant, only some of the metabolites were accessible, even with the ternary solvent system. For these samples, the leaves could be imaged with direct {DESI} after chloroform had been used to remove most of the cuticle, thus exposing lower layers in the leaf structure. A number of considerations regarding selection of samples and instrumental parameters that must be made in direct {DESI} imaging of plant materials are discussed.},

While the {UWB} {SAR} is the lead sensor, with a capability for foliage penetration and target identification, confirmation and additional target discrimination is provided by polarimetric {IR} imaging to give a 24 hr capability. A ground station processor, based on {COTS} systems, has been developed to fuse all sensor outputs in a decision level process through a variety of target detection and identification algorithms. Probabilistic analysis is used on the resulting outputs to define the extent of a minefield to the system operator.

	abstract = {This paper is a summary of the current knowledge of laser-generated aerosols under atmospheric conditions. It is restricted to typical laser sampling conditions as they are used in {LA}-{ICP} spectrometry. Published experimental evidence and proposed models are reviewed and critical summarized. The collected works show that a certain agreement exists that independently of the sample two size fractions with different chemical composition are found. The mechanism generating the different particle fractions are currently not clear. Possible sources of particle generation are described and critically reviewed. Fundamentally three distinguishable modes (gas, liquid, solid) can be described that can appear: gas-to-particle conversion, hydrodynamic sputtering, mechanical spallation/exfoliation. More recently explosive boiling as a mechanism of liquid expulsion has been discussed as a further possible source under certain conditions. Particle conditioning during transport is discussed as a source for agglomeration. The correlation between size distribution and laser parameters is discussed.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the radiative transport between particles, particularly the case of nano-sized particles, can exceed the black body limit when the separation between the particles less than the thermal wavelength λ\_T∼hc{\textbackslash}/(k\_B T).  This energy exchange can drastically affect the temperature profile of a system.  The ability to influence the temperature profile of a system has applications in microprocessor design and thermophotovoltaic cell efficiency.  Recent work has shown that the temperature dependence of a system of dipoles is influenced by the configuration.  Other work has demonstrated a methodology to investigate the total flux into closely separated bodies using the boundary element method.  This computational method permits the insertion of test surfaces into the two-body system to readily assess the directionality of the electromagnetic flux at additional points in space.  By studying the effect of particle shape and orientation of the flux through such a test surface, it will be possible to establish geometric configurations to directionally channel the electromagnetic flux through a system of particles.  In this poster, we outline the methodology to compute the flux distribution and consider the flux in the initial case between a sphere and a spheroid as a function of eccentricity.},

In terms of collision and streaming, the present approach of the {LBM} for radiative heat  transfer is similar to those being used in fluid dynamics and heat transfer for the analyses of conduction and convection problems. However, to mitigate the effect of the isotropy in the polar direction, in the present {LBM} approach, lattices with more number of directions than those being used for the 2-D system have been employed. The {LBM} formulation has been validated by solving benchmark radiative equilibrium problems in 1-D and 2-D Cartesian geometry. Temperature and heat flux distributions have been obtained for a wide range of extinction coefficients. The {LBM} results have been compared against the results obtained from the finite-volume method ({FVM}). Good comparison has been obtained. The numbers of iterations and {CPU} times for the {LBM} and the {FVM} have also been compared. The number of iterations in the {LBM} has been found to be much more than the {FVM}.

In particular, the objectives are to understand the physics of these signatures in traditionally difficult detection environments (buildings, caves, tunnels, camouflaged settings), identify sensor network constructs to record these signatures, and develop processing techniques (e.g., distributed processing) to exploit these signatures for personnel detection. During this reporting period, the technical efforts focused on three sensor domains: seismic/acoustics, electro-optics, and radar. Seismic/acoustics technical efforts investigated use of passive and active sensing modes. Electro-optics research focused on continued development of a multi-modal human signature \& urban model, collecting motion data, development of motion-based detection algorithms, and developing techniques for detection in low pixel video sequences. Additional work focused on exploiting motion capture data for human motion characterization and discrimination. Radar-based research focused on investigating improving autoregressive modeling approaches for gait detection.},

The analysis is focused on the surface-surface and surface-particle configurations. We show that relativistic effects give rise to a mixing of the contributions from the electromagnetic waves with different polarization to the heat transfer and the interaction forces. We find that these effects are of the order (V/c)2. The limiting case when one of the bodies is sufficiently rarefied gives the heat transfer and the interaction forces between a moving small particle and a surface. We also calculate the friction force acting on a particle moving with an arbitrary velocity relative to the black body radiation.},

Several methods have been designed to evaluate these coefficients but the most efficient one relies on the use of localization operators, leading to localized approximations and to localized beam models, whose history and features are reviewed in this paper. Localized approximations and localized beam models have been particularly useful for speeding up numerical computations in the framework of generalized Lorenz-Mie theories ({GLMTs}), i.e. theories dealing with the interaction between electromagnetic arbitrary shaped beams and a regular particle, allowing one to solve the problem by using the method of separation of variables. However, they can be useful in other scattering approaches, such as the extended boundary condition method (or null-field method), or more generally, when the need of an efficient description of an electromagnetic arbitrary shaped beam is required.},

Key questions and research priorities regarding these four areas are synthesized in this paper, and outstanding issues for future research are presented for each topical area.

We compare the behavior of the conductance as a function of the distance between the particles with the result obtained by means of molecular dynamics simulations.

The grating with one-dimensional microstructured surface is relatively easy to fabricate and the predicted directional-spectral emittance exhibits apparent enhancement over simple grating structures. Specifically, the emittance of the complex grating has a wider peak in the spectral region where the quantum efficiency of {TPV} cells is high. This enhancement can be explained by the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons coupled with the grating microstructures. At longer wavelengths, the emittance remains low to reduce the radiative heat transfer from the radiator to the {TPV} cells by low-energy photons that do not produce any photocurrent. Calculations using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis demonstrate that the emittance peak is insensitive to the direction, suggesting that the proposed structure may be well suitable for {TPV} applications.},

An electronic digital computer was programmed to compute the electromagnetic field across the mirrors of the interferometer where an initially launched wave is reflected back and forth between the mirrors. It was found that after many reflections a state is reached in which the relative field decays at an exponential rate. This steady-state field distribution is regarded as a normal mode of the interferometer. Many such normal modes are possible depending upon the initial wave distribution. The lowest-order mode, which has the lowest diffraction loss, has a high intensity at the middle of the mirror and rather low intensities at the edges. Therefore, the diffraction loss is much lower than would be predicted for a uniform plane wave. Curves for field distribution and diffraction loss are given for different mirror geometries and different modes. Since each mode has a characteristic loss and phase shift per transit, a uniform plane wave which can be resolved into many modes cannot be resonated in an interferometer. In the usual optical interferometers, the resolution is too poor to resolve the individual mode resonances and the uniform plane wave distribution may be maintained approximately. However, in an oscillating maser, the lowest-order mode should dominate if the mirror spacing is correct for resonance. A confocal spherical system is also investigated and the losses are shown to be orders of magnitude less than for plane mirrors.},

We also find that heat transfer can be further enhanced at selective frequencies when the slabs are brought into a glide-symmetric configuration, a consequence of the degeneracies associated with the nonsymmorphic symmetry group.},

	abstract = {In conventional lasers, the optical cavity that confines the photons also determines essential characteristics of the lasing modes such as wavelength, emission pattern, directivity, and polarization. In random lasers, which do not have mirrors or a well-defined cavity, light is confined within the gain medium by means of multiple scattering. The sharp peaks in the emission spectra of semiconductor powders, first observed in 1999, has therefore lead to an intense debate about the nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant feedback. We review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at clarifying the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with gain. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of the idea that even the low-Q resonances of such open systems could play a role similar to the cavity modes of a conventional laser and produce sharp lasing peaks. We focus here on the near-threshold single-mode lasing regime where nonlinear effects associated with gain saturation and mode competition can be neglected. We discuss in particular the link between random laser modes near threshold and the resonances or quasi-bound ({QB}) states of the passive system without gain. For random lasers in the localized (strong scattering) regime, {QB} states and threshold lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering medium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy systems such as random systems in the diffusive regime, where it was observed that increasing the openness of such systems eventually resulted in measurable and increasing differences between quasi-bound states and lasing modes. Very recently, a theory able to treat lasers with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random lasers established that the threshold lasing modes are in fact distinct from {QB} states of the passive system and are better described in terms of a new class of states, the so-called constant-flux states. The correspondence between {QB} states and lasing modes is found to improve in the strong scattering limit, confirming the validity of initial work in the strong scattering limit.},

The atmospheric extinction of laser radiation at wavelengths commonly used in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (1064 nm and 532 nm) and of the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy plasma emission beyond 250 nm is small compared to the attenuation with range due to the inverse square law. The fundamental problem with light propagation through the atmosphere is that the atmospheric transmittance does not remain constant within the whole spectral interval, and that this variation results in a change in the spectral distribution of the light received by the detector. Knowledge of atmospheric transmittance would allow for compensation of this effect.},

The results can be expressed as basis-independent trace formulas in terms of the scattering operators of the individual objects. We prove that heat radiation of a single object is positive, and that heat transfer (for two arbitrary passive objects) is from the hotter to a colder body. The heat transferred is also symmetric, exactly reversed if the two temperatures are exchanged. Introducing partial wave expansions, we transform the results for radiation, transfer, and forces into traces of matrices that can be evaluated in any basis, analogous to the equilibrium Casimir force. The method is illustrated by (re)deriving the heat radiation of a plate, a sphere, and a cylinder. We analyze the radiation of a sphere for different materials, emphasizing that a simplification often employed for metallic nanospheres is typically invalid. We derive asymptotic formulas for heat transfer and nonequilibrium interactions for the cases of a sphere in front a plate and for two spheres, extending previous results. As an example, we show that a hot nanosphere can levitate above a plate with the repulsive nonequilibrium force overcoming gravity, an effect that is not due to radiation pressure.},

All solutions of this integral equation are found to be expressible as quadratic forms involving the Fox—Li modes of the conventional theory. If there is no degeneracy, each mode is shown to be necessarily completely spatially coherent, at each frequency, within the framework of second-order correlation theory.

The reflection and transmission spectra of the photonic crystals were calculated by transfer matrix method of thin-film optical theory. The calculation results show that the designed multi-cycle dual-hetero-junction photonic crystal has a high spectral reflectance in the near, middle and far infrared band, whose spectral reflectance is greater than 99\% in 1∼5\&\#xa0;μm and 8∼14\&\#xa0;μm infrared bands, and spectral transmittance at 1.06\&\#xa0;μm and 10.6\&\#xa0;μm is greater than 96\%.

A large part of the present paper is devoted to the calculation of the response functions involving different geometries and various types of dielectrics. Both spatially dispersive and spatially nondispersive dielectrics are considered. The response functions are calculated using Maxwell's equations and the usual boundary conditions at the interface adjoining the two mediums. As a first application of the present approach, the black-body fluctuations in finite geometries and the influence of surfaces on its temporal and spatial coherence are studied.

By making assumptions which relate both the psychophysically obtained threshold and saturating intensities of the flash to a supposed physiological response, models describing the shifts in the dynamic range can be tested. The present study examines the effects on threshold and saturation produced by various steady adapting intensities. The data are fit by a model incorporating changes in both the semisaturation constant of the system and the maximum response elicited by a flash.},

The historical origin of this understanding of the phenomenon is briefly discussed. We consider several physical systems that may exhibit normal electromagnetic waves (polaritons) with negative group velocity at optical frequencies. These systems are analyzed in a unified way provided by the spatial dispersion framework. The framework utilizes the notion of the generalized dielectric tensor ε ij ( ω , k ) representing the electromagnetic response of the medium to perturbations of frequency ω and wave vector k . Polaritons with negative group velocity can exist in media (whether in natural or in artificial meta-materials) with a sufficiently strong spatial dispersion. Our examples include both gyrotropic and nongyrotropic systems, and bulk and surface polariton waves. We also discuss the relation between the spatial dispersion approach and the more familiar, but more restricted, description involving the dielectric permittivity ε ( ω ) and the magnetic permeability μ ( ω ) .},

The expression for {LDOS} is obtained by relating the electromagnetic energy density at any location in a medium at uniform temperature T to the electric and magnetic {DGFs}. The appropriate boundary conditions governing the {DGFs} are obtained and it is seen that the two types of {DGFs} are electromagnetic duals of each other. With this the concept of {LDOS} is also extended to material media. The {LDOS} is split into two terms—one that originates from the energy density in an infinite, homogeneous medium and the other that takes into account scattering from inhomogeneities. The second part can always be defined unambiguously, even in lossy materials. For lossy materials, the first part is finite only if spatial dispersion is taken into account.},

	abstract = {For most of its 60 year history, the Casimir effect was an obscure theoretical backwater, but technological advances over the past decade have promoted this curious manifestation of quantum and thermal fluctuations to a position of central importance in modern experimental physics. Dramatic progress in the measurement of Casimir forces since 1997 has created a demand for theoretical tools that can predict Casimir interactions in realistic experimental geometries and in materials with realistic frequency-dependent electrical properties. This work presents a new paradigm for efficient numerical computation of Casimir interactions. Our new technique, which we term the fluctuating-surface-current ({FSC}) approach to computational Casimir physics, borrows ideas from the boundary-element method of computational electromagnetism to express Casimir energies, forces, and torques between bodies of arbitrary shapes and materials in terms of interactions among effective electric and magnetic surface currents flowing on the surfaces of the objects. We demonstrate that the master equations of the {FSC} approach arise as logical consequences of either of two seemingly disparate Casimir paradigms-the stress-tensor approach and the path-integral (or scattering) approach-and this work thus achieves an unexpected unification of these two otherwise quite distinct theoretical frameworks. But a theoretical technique is only as relevant as its practical implementations are useful, and for this reason we present three distinct numerical implementations of the {FSC} formulae, each of which poses a series of unique technical challenges. Finally, using our new theoretical paradigm and our practical implementations of it, we obtain new predictions of Casimir interactions in a number of experimentally relevant geometric and material configurations that would be difficult or impossible to treat with any other existing Casimir method.},

Unlike previous approaches to nonequilibrium fluctuations that involve scattering matrices—relating “incoming” and “outgoing” waves from each body—our approach is formulated in terms of “unknown” surface currents, laying at the surfaces of the bodies, that need not satisfy any wave equation. We show that our formulation can be applied as a spectral method to obtain fast-converging semianalytical formulas in high-symmetry geometries using specialized spectral bases that conform to the surfaces of the bodies (e.g., Fourier series for planar bodies or spherical harmonics for spherical bodies), and can also be employed as a numerical method by exploiting the generality of surface meshes/grids to obtain results in more complicated geometries (e.g., interleaved bodies as well as bodies with sharp corners). In particular, our formalism allows direct application of the boundary-element method, a robust and powerful numerical implementation of the surface-integral formulation of classical electromagnetism, which we use to obtain results in new geometries, such as the heat transfer between finite slabs, cylinders, and cones.},

The relation of the Lewis factor to the Lewis number is also investigated. The influence of the Lewis factor on the prediction of wet-cooling tower performance is subsequently investigated. The Poppe heat and mass transfer analysis of evaporative cooling are considered as the Lewis factor can be explicitly specified. It is found that if the same definition or value of the Lewis factor is employed in the fill test analysis and in the subsequent cooling tower performance analysis, the water outlet temperature will be accurately predicted. The amount of water that evaporates, however, is a function of the actual value of the Lewis factor. If the inlet ambient air temperature is relatively high, the influence of the Lewis factor, on tower performance diminishes. It is very important, in the view of the Lewis factor that any cooling tower fill test be conducted under conditions that are as close as possible to the conditions specified for cooling tower operating conditions.},

A new recursion relation is derived which reduces the computation effort by several orders of magnitude so that a quantitative analysis for spheres as large as10lambdain radius at a spacing as small as two spheres in contact becomes feasible. Simplification and approximation for various cases are also given. With the availability of exact solution, the usefulness of various approximate solutions can be determined quantitatively. For high frequencies, the ray-optical solution is given for two conducting spheres. In addition to the geometric and creeping wave rays pertaining to each sphere alone, there are rays that undergo multiple reflections, multiple creeps, and combinations of both, called the hybrid rays. Numerical results show that the ray-optical solution can be accurate for spheres as small aslambda/4in radius is some cases. Despite some shortcomings, this approach provides much physical insight into the multiple scattering phenomena.},

@article{mie_optics_1908,
	title = {Optics of turbid media},
	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Deals with turbid media on the assumption that the particles may be regarded as spherical, and that the turbidity is infinitely thin in the optical sense. The latter condition is fulfilled in ordinary colloid solutions. The light emitted by the small particles may be calculated as a series of partial waves. There are two groups of these, corresponding respectively to the electric and magnetic vibrations of the particles. In colloid solutions with very fine particles only the first electrical term, which corresponds to Rayleigh's radiation, has a perceptible value. With coarser particles the second electric and the first magnetic vibration also come into play. The assumption of a perfect conductivity of the spheres leads to different results, and must be abandoned. If an unpolarised ray traverses the turbid liquid the light emitted laterally is linearly polarised, partially or entirely, but is never elliptically polarised. Up to a size of 0.1μ the light diffused by gold particles laterally consists almost entirely of Rayleigh's radiation, which has a maximum (100 per cent.) at 90°. When the particles become larger the amount of light unpolarised at 90° rapidly increases, and the maximum of polarisation moves forward. For particles from 0.16 to 0.18 μ it lies between 110° and 120°. At the same time the mutual interference of the partial waves disturbs the original symmetry of Rayleigh's radiation, and another argument against the perfect conductivity of the spherules is obtained. At constant concentrations the diffused radiation of very fine turbidities is proportional to the volume of the individual particle. But as the particles increase it tends towards a maximum, which it reaches at a diam. of λ/3 or λ/4. The colour of light diffused from very fine particles is bluish-violet, and from coarser ones white. No explanation, by resonance or otherwise, is yet obtained as regards the vivid colours of some colloid solutions. Gold particles diffuse more light than would be diffused by equal perfectly-conducting particles. The colour of colloid gold is explained by the maximum absorption in the green and the maximum reflection in the orange. Very small particles absorb much and reflect little, and the solution is therefore ruby-red.},

The electromagnetic energy flux is expressed through the expectation value of the Poynting vector. In order to compute the Poynting vector, two techniques suitable for nonequilibrium processes are employed: the Heisenberg equations of motion and the diagrammatic Keldysh procedure. They are shown to give identical final results.

	abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method ({LBM}) was used to solve the energy equation of a transient conduction-radiation heat transfer problem. The finite volume method ({FVM}) was used to compute the radiative information. To study the compatibility of the {LBM} for the energy equation and the {FVM} for the radiative transfer equation, transient conduction and radiation heat transfer problems in 1-D planar and 2-D rectangular geometries were considered. In order to establish the suitability of the {LBM}, the energy equations of the two problems were also solved using the {FVM} of the computational fluid dynamics. The {FVM} used in the radiative heat transfer was employed to compute the radiative information required for the solution of the energy equation using the {LBM} or the {FVM} (of the {CFD}). To study the compatibility and suitability of the {LBM} for the solution of energy equation and the {FVM} for the radiative information, results were analyzed for the effects of various parameters such as the scattering albedo, the conduction-radiation parameter and the boundary emissivity. The results of the {LBM}-{FVM} combination were found to be in excellent agreement with the {FVM}-{FVM} combination. The number of iterations and {CPU} times in both the combinations were found comparable.},

The designs were selected to theoretically assess the relative balance between conductive and radiative heat transport mechanisms in a {TBC}, and hence to provide guidance on how to optimize the physical and geometric design of a {TBC}. The primary design purpose was to achieve high reflectance to radiation within a wavelength range of 0.3\&\#xa0;∼\&\#xa0;6\&\#xa0;μm, which is typical of a gas turbine combustion environment. These structures, with overall thickness of 250\&\#xa0;μm, consist of several sets of highly reflective multiple layered stacks and a single layer ceramic material with low thermal conductivity. Within the multiple layered stacks, each stack was specifically designed to reflect a targeted range of wavelength. A broadband reflection within the required wavelength range was achieved by using 12 stacks each containing 12 individual layers. Computational analysis indicated that the substrate metal temperature could be further reduced by as much as 45\&\#xa0;°C if a multiple layered coating was used in place of a monolayer of ceramic coating of the same thickness. The effect of scattering in the multiple layered thermal barrier coating system was also evaluated and is discussed in this study.},

Fluctuations in both atomic emission and plasma continuum emission are investigated in concert for a homogenous gaseous flow, and fluctuations in plasma temperature are reported based on iron atomic emission in an aerosol-seeded flow. Threshold irradiance for plasma initiation and plasma absorption were investigated for pure gaseous and aerosol streams, with detailed statistical measurements performed as a function of pulse energy in the breakdown regime. The ratio of the analyte atomic emission intensity to the continuum emission intensity (peak/base) provided a robust signal for single-shot {LIBS} analysis. Moreover, at optimal temporal delay, the precision of the {LIBS} signal was maximized for pulse energies within the saturation regime with respect to plasma absorption of incident energy. Finally, single-shot temperature measurements were analyzed, leading to the conclusion that spatial variations in the plasma volume formation and subsequent plasma emission collection, play important roles in the overall shot-to-shot precision of the {LIBS} technique for gaseous and aerosol analysis.},

Conditions of starting acceleration from standstill of an example passenger car equipped with a manual transmission, or an automatic gearbox, or even a continuously variable transmission, are simulated to demonstrate the versatility of this package. Finally, a proportional-integral throttle control model, simulating the behaviour of the driver, is also devised aiming to follow the prescribed transient driving schedule in the driving pattern simulation},

Lett. 103 040401 (2009)] to allow treatment of objects with arbitrary material properties, including imperfect conductors, dielectrics, and magnetic materials. Our original method considered electric currents on the surfaces of the interacting objects; the extended method considers both electric and magnetic surface current distributions, and obtains the Casimir energy of a configuration of objects in terms of the interactions of these effective surface currents. Using this new technique, we present the first predictions of Casimir interactions in several experimentally relevant geometries that would be difficult to treat with any existing method. In particular, we investigate Casimir interactions between dielectric nanodisks embedded in a dielectric fluid; we identify the threshold surface-surface separation at which finite-size effects become relevant, and we map the rotational energy landscape of bound nanoparticle diclusters.},

	abstract = {In the present study, an unstructured finite volume method for radiative transfer  in 3-D enclosure with inhomegeneous participating medium is developed. That method is applicable for complex geometry enclosure. The computational domain is divided into many tetrahedral volume cells, which is easily applied into structured or unstructured. A general discretization equation based on step scheme for spatial differencing and azimuthal discretization in angular domain was derived. In order to validated the developed unstructured finite volume method, three test cases were chosen, including a cubic enclosure with absorbing-emitting medium, an equilateral triangular enclosure with absorbing-emitting medium, a 3D L-shaped enclosure with absorbing-emitting/scattering medium. All the solutions based on the present method have a good agreement with available other solutions. Then, one case with more complex geometry, a hollow cubic enclosure with absorbing-emitting and isotropic scattering medium, was investigated. The effects of scattering albedo on wall radiative flux, incident radiation  and radiative flux divergence were analyzed. It was found that the developed model is reliable and accurate and suitable for radiative transfer in complex 3-D enclosure with inhomegeneous absorbing-emitting and scattering medium. (14 refs.)},

The problem chosen is transient conductive and radiative heat transfer in a 2-D rectangular enclosure filled with an optically absorbing, emitting and scattering medium. The energy equation of the problem is solved alternatively with a previously used finite volume method ({FVM}) and with the {LBM}, while the radiative transfer equation is solved in both cases using the collapsed dimension method. In a parametric study on the effects of the conduction-radiation parameter, extinction coefficient, scattering albedo, and enclosure aspect ratio, {FVM} and {LBM} are compared in each case. It is found that, for given level of accuracy, {LBM} converges in fewer iterations to the steady-state solution, independent of the influence of radiation. On the other hand, the computational cost per iteration is higher for {LBM} than for the {FVM} for a simple grid. For coupled radiation-diffusion, the {LBM} is faster than the {FVM} because the radiative transfer computation is more time-consuming than that of diffusion.},

When the two objects are spheres, the dyadic Green’s function can be expanded in a series of vector spherical waves. Based on comparison with the convergence criterion for the case of radiative transfer between two parallel surfaces, we derive a relation for the number of vector spherical waves required for convergence in the case of radiative transfer between two spheres. We show that when electromagnetic surface waves are active at a frequency the number of vector spherical waves required for convergence is proportional to Rmax/d when d/Rmax → 0, where Rmax is the radius of the larger sphere, and d is the smallest gap between the two spheres. This criterion for convergence applies equally well to other near-field electromagnetic scattering problems.},

The introduction of an artificial dielectric periodicity in the Si, with a surface, vapor-deposited gold (Au) metal film, governs the photonic frequency spectrum of permitted propagation, which then couples with surface plasmon states at the metal surface. Narrow band spectral tuning was accomplished through control of symmetry and lattice spacing of the {PBG} patterns. Transfer matrix calculations were used to model the frequency dependence of reflectance for several lattice spacings. Theoretical predictions that showed narrow-band reflectance at relevant wavelengths for gas sensing and detection were then compared to measured reflectance spectra from processed devices.

In addition, numerical calculation computed with rigorous coupled-wave analysis ({RCWA}) is performed on the microstructured samples. The selective-emission peaks measured through experiments can be reproduced well by {RCWA}, and this result suggests strongly that the thermal radiation from periodic structures may have spatial coherence.

Des relations sont données pour la température de surfaces, opaques ou non, soumises à des flux de rayonnement bien déterminés.
Die Berechnung von Temperaturen strahlungsundurchlässiger und durchlässiger Oberflächen bei gegebener Strahlungsmenge wird untersucht. Jede undurchlässige Oberfläche eines grauen Strahlers in einer willkürlich aufgebauten Umhüllung nimmt im Strahlungsgleichgewicht eine gleichmässige Endtemperatur an, unabhängig vom Emissionsvermögen (oder Absorptionsvermögen) der Oberfläche. Die Abhängigkeit der Temperatur undurchlässiger und durchlässiger Oberflächen von der zugeführten Strahlungsmenge ist angegeben.},

A modified version of the normalized emissivity method ({NEM}), utilizing independently scaled maximum emissivities in each channel, was applied to thermal data acquired by the Multispectral Thermal Imager ({MTI}) with two {MIR} channels, J (3.81 [mu]m) and K (4.97 [mu]m), and three {LWIR} channels, L (8.26 [mu]m), M (8.65 [mu]m), and N (10.51 [mu]m). Atmosphere-free simulations of T and [epsilon] retrieval over a wide variety of terrestrial surfaces yielded T values within ± 0.75 K of [`]true T' in the range of 270-330 K and [epsilon] values within ± 0.011 of true [epsilon] in channels L, M and N, and ± 0.019 and ± 0.023 in channels K and J, respectively. The algorithm was tested successfully using {MTI} data over the Mauna Loa caldera in Hawaii. Unconstrained effects of shading and unresolved shadows in channel J day time data, and the strong atmospheric effects in channel K limit the application of the algorithm, in its present form, to night-time data.},

The resulting noise enhancement can be very sizable (100 to 1000 times or more) in gain-guided laser oscillators, and especially in laser oscillators using geometrically unstable cavities with moderate to high magnifications and Fresnel numbers.},

Since the shape and depth of the atmospheric water bands are influenced not only by the water present but also by surface (background) reflectance, atmospheric scattering, and instrument radiance by calibration, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the radiative transfer code {LOWTRAN} 7 (Kneizys et al., 1988) to determine which one of these two approaches will provide a better estimate over land and water areas. The {CIBR} proved to be the technique less sensitive to perturbing effects, except for errors in visibility estimate. Both techniques were applied to {AVIRIS} radiance data acquired over Salton Sea, California. Resulting images confirmed that the use of a constant gray reflectance in the model led to a higher overestimation of the amount of water retrieved for N/W over vegetated areas. Validation was performed through comparison between an independent estimate of water vapor from concurrent Reagan sunphotometer measurements and {AVIRIS} estimates. Amounts retrieved using the N/W approach match more closely in situ measurements, even after adjusting model parameters for background reflectance, viewing geometry and type of aerosol at the site. The 13\% underestimation observed for the {CIBR} was explained by small differences [Delta]L([lambda]i) between {AVIRIS} and {LOWTRAN} 7 modeled radiances. Results from this study emphasizes the importance of accurate instrument calibration in flight and correct physical modeling of atmospheric absorptions.},

	abstract = {The ability of the cone visual system to regulate its sensitivity from twilight to bright sunlight is an extraordinary feat of biology. Here, we investigate the changes in visual processing that accompany cone light adaptation over a 5 log
10 unit intensity range by combining measures of temporal sensitivity made in one eye with measures of the temporal delay
between the two eyes in different states of adaptation. This combination of techniques, which provides more complete information than has been available before, leads to a simple model of steady-state light adaptation. At high light levels, visual sensitivity is maintained mainly by photopigment bleaching. At low-to-moderate light levels, it is maintained by trading unwanted sensitivity for speed and by an additional process that paradoxically
increases the overall sensitivity as the light level rises. Each stage of the model can be linked to molecular mechanisms within the photoreceptor: The speeding up can be linked to faster rates of decay of activated molecules; the paradoxical sensitivity increases can be linked to faster rates of molecular resynthesis and to changes in channel sensitivity; and the sensitivity decreases can be linked to bleaching. Together, these mechanisms act to maintain the cone visual system in an optimal operating range and to protect it from overload.},

In this work we analyze the probability of recovery as a function of object spatial frequency. The analysis uses a physical model for the acquired signal and noise, and also accounts for potential postacquisition noise filtering. Linear-systems analysis yields an effective cutoff frequency, which is induced by noise, despite having no optical blur in the imaging model. This means that a low signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) in images causes resolution loss, similar to image blur. We further consider the effect on {SNR} of pointwise image formation models, such as added specular or indirect reflections, additive scattering, radiance attenuation in haze, and flash photography. The result is a tool that assesses the ability to recover (within a desirable success rate) an object or feature having a certain size, distance from the camera, and radiance difference from its nearby background, per attenuation coefficient of the medium. The bounds rely on the camera specifications.},

Some fundamental aspects related to important micro/nanoscale processes in semiconductor optoelectronics are presented. These include the electronic band structure, energy gap, interband and intraband transitions, free-carrier absorption, optical and acoustic phonons, and the effects of impurities and temperature. Theoretical and experimental studies on the radiative properties of thin films and multilayer systems, rough surfaces, and nanostructured surfaces are summarized. Quantum confinement in nanomaterials is described, followed by a review of the radiative properties of photonic crystals and porous silicon.
